Programming by functionnality with events.

Only one import needed :

    from reactor import R

Sending an event :

    answer = R('event-type', arg1, arg2...)
    # 'answer' is None if nobody managed the event
    #          or the data returned by the event handler

Event receiver :

    @R.handler('event-type','OPTIONAL_PRIORIY_AS_A_STRING')
    def function_name(arguments):
        """
        Argument as ('event-type', arg1, arg2...)
        This function may update the arguments objects
        """
        return "Any data to stop event processing"
        return None # To let over handlers analyse the event

The main program can store the application full state in R.M
so it is usable by any event handler.
